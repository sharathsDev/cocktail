    "history": "Beer blending has been common in English alehouses since at least the 17th century. The term “Black and Tan” in reference to a beer mix appeared in print in 1881 in an American magazine; the first British reference is from 1889. The drink traditionally combines a pale ale or lager with a stout or porter. The layering effect is possible because stout has a lower density and floats atop the lighter beer. Although commonly associated with Ireland in modern pubs, the name can be politically sensitive there due to a historical paramilitary force called the Black and Tans — in Ireland the drink is often ordered as a “Half and Half.”",
    "funFacts": [
      "The classic version uses English Bass Pale Ale and Irish Guinness Draught stout.",
      "Some modern breweries sell ready‑mixed “Black & Tan” beer.",
      "A specially bent spoon is often used to pour the stout gently and preserve the layers."
